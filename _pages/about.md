Hi! I recently finished my MSc. in Scientific Computing at University College London where I was fortunate to be supervised by [Professor Timo Betcke](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=HCAkiTYAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Jamie Quinn](http://jamiejquinn.com/). I am broadly interested in High Performance Computing in the context of Deep Learning.

Previously, I spent time at Risklab working on [machine learning models for portfolio optimization](https://www.pm-research.com/content/iijjfds/early/2023/09/23/jfds20231138) and before that, I was an undergraduate researcher at the University of Toronto working on mathematical modelling applied to Circadian Rhythms.

I completed my undergradaute degree in Mathematics and Physics (Math Specialist/Physics Major) at the University of Toronto.
