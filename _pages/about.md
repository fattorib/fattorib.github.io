Hi! I'm currently a M.Sc Student at University College London studying Scientific Computing. I am also a Data Scientist with Omnia AI (Deloitte Canada). I am broadly interested in High Performance Computing in the context of Deep Learning, more specifically applied to Natural Language Processing.   

Previously, I spent time at Risklab working on machine learning models for portfolio optimization and before that, I was an undergraduate researcher at U of T working on mathematical modelling applied to Circadian Rhythms.

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics from the University of Toronto. 

You can find my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ToM_wgh8718W7GwO78DowAcKf3gm4PMa/view) (Updated April 2023)
